# Sample gitconfig
#
# This is a sample gitconfig. Usually we keep a lot of sensitive information
# here (things like authentication tokens, email addresses, and so on), so this
# file is ignored in this project's .gitignore.
#
# To set this up, rename this file to `gitconfig.symlink` and you'll be able to
# install this to the correct location by running the project's main `rake`
# task.
